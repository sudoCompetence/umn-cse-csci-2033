Python notebooks aren't unique to Colab (you may have heard of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) before), but they are the main format of a Colab notebook, so it is important to know how to use them. In this section, you will learn more about the basics of Python notebooks, how to create content within them, and some helpful tips when it comes to working with Python notebooks."
